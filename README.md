- üë®‚Äçüéì My research interests are centered around **unseen object robotic manipulation**, focusing on segmentation, grasping, and placement of novel objects using deep learning.

- I completed my PhD under the supervision of Professor [Kyoobin Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QVihy5MAAAAJ&hl) at [GIST](https://www.gist.ac.kr/) from 2018 to 2024. During my doctoral studies, I interned as an Applied Scientist at [Amazon Robotics](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/how-amazon-robotics-researchers-are-solving-a-beautiful-problem) in Berlin from 2023 to 2024. I am also a two-time recipient of the [Samsung HumanTech Paper Awards](https://humantech.samsung.com/saitext/index.jsp) in 2022 and 2023.

- My research has been successfully applied to Amazon warehouse robots, furniture assembly, and human-robot collaboration. Currently, I am expanding my work on test-time adaptation and foundation models to improve robustness in new domains. Check more details in my [personal website](https://backseunghyeok.com)

- üì¨ Feel free to reach out for collaboration, questions, or just a chat about robotics and AI!
